# The Bloggity Project (WIP)
The project aims to deliver an easy way to build, customize and host your own, independent blog — both in the infrastructure and freedom of speech sense.

## The philosophy

The Internet is clearly a centralized thing now. Even though nowadays everyone is a creator in some way, the flow and distribiution of information are managed by big, self-interest oriented platforms. 

The Bloggity Project tries to solve that problem, allowing everybody to contribute for the decentralization of information and self-manage information they post on the Internet. Bloggity tries to become the most **accessible**, **free** and **powerful** tool to do this.

## How?

There are a few simple concepts, that are employed to build the experience described above.
- **References**: Bloggity is planned to be release with a concept of *meta-web* built in. Every blog Creator will be able to invite other Creators to referral program through the standarized and integrated protocol, which will ensure, that referrer is also referred by the other side.
- **Auto-configuration tool**: There is a planned tool, that will make the configuration of blog  as easy, as creating an account on a social media platform.
- **Cheap to maintain**: PHP is supported on every major hosting and it's proportionaly cheaper to host than other technologies. Also, thanks to the meta-web feature, domains no longer matter — even to the point of ability to use free domain.
- **Auto-generated SEO**: If Creator aims to merge traditional methods of gaining audience with a meta-web feature, Bloggity will generate sitemaps and necessary files to view posts and articles in feeds.
- **Extensibility**: Future plans include custom layouts and components to build upon existing framework.
